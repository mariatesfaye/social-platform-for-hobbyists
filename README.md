# social-platform-for-hobbyists
Social platforms provide an easy-to-use interface, an open forum to connect with people from
all over the world, and the opportunity to engage in discussions. Essentially these
functionalities are the basis of a social media app.
Using websites and applications to communicate informally with others, find people, and
share similar interests can be beneficial to people who are having a hard time finding people
with similar interests in their areas. Allows users to directly connect with one another through
groups, networks, and location is therefore crucial and a central idea in this project. In this
circumstance, we thought of building an app that will fulfill these things.
This project is a php project that can let you send a friend request to other users to interact
with. Upon signing up, users can choose up to 14 different hobbies. These hobbies are preselected for this project, meaning that there will be a
list of hobbies to choose from. These 14 hobbies are then part of the respective userâ€™s profile,
and they are sorted in decreasing priority, i.e. your first hobby is your most important/favorite
hobby, your second hobby in the list is a little lower in priority than the first one etc. The
admin then has access to these hobbies, and pairs up people who have similar/compatible
hobbies, and allows them to send friend requests to each other. After this is done, people can
then message each other and have conversations.
